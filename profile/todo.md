# ‚û°Ô∏è To-do:
<sup><sup>*items are not in order of completion</sup></sup>

## üîú Next Release:
- fix DiscordChatBridge webhook avatar icon being Steve. Probably just need to change which mc chat head provider the plugin points to.

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è Planned:
- custom chat colors, use by typing `&#` before the hex color. Potential for custom name colors in chat.
- add debug line in F3 menu that shows what block ID, block name translation key and metadata of the block you're looking at.
- fix lighting around transparent blocks like signs
- overhaul texture system; add a 2nd terrain.png
- native controller support (for handheld devices like Steam Deck)
- make Creepers spawn less frequently
- make mobs only spawn in light levels less than 2 or 1
- add shift-clicking for furnaces and armor slots
- add Redstone Lamps
- fix redstone update order
- add an item specifically for claim/selection wand
- wooden buttons
- optimize weather rendering [C]
- add option to turn off grass side rendering [C]
- fix fullscreen on Linux [C] (probably by just making the window borderless windowed)

## ‚õî Abandoned/Not completable:
- edit DiscordChatLink and increase delay of the starting message **--no longer necessary**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ideas:
- right click to sit on slab?
- add spruce and birch planks?
- add a fourth tree type?
