# :arrow_right: To-do:

## Next Release:

##  Planned:
- crouch to place on interactable blocks

## Abandoned/Not completable:

## ℹ️ Ideas:
- right click to sit on slab?
- add spruce and birch planks?
- add a fourth tree type?

- add structures like strongholds or villages from b1.8.1? (strongholds would be purely decorational)
